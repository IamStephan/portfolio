## About The Project

<br />

With more experience and new projects to showcase, I thought it would make
sense to update my portfolio. Aiming for performance and a somewhat
pleasant-to-look-at design, I used NextJS and TailwindCSS as the base
for this project.

In an attempt to keep performance as good as possible, I designed and
developed most of the components, sections and logic from scratch and
used as few libraries as I could (where it made sense).

There were some interesting challenges while working on this. Most
notably, the handling of MDX content. There are 2 main libraries used
for this (next-remote-mdx and mdx-bundler); both would've been perfect
for what I wanted. I ended up going with next-remote-mdx since it would
allow me to later extract the content if needed. The only problem;
next/image does not work with it unless you deal with it yourself
(and I really wanted to use next/image with blur placeholders).

### Handling mdx content images

To handle this, I created a token-based system. A simple strategy
to reference images inside mdx files. Simply place this,
`image('path_to_image', 'alt text')`, where the image needs to go
and, depending on where it's used, would insert the appropriate
data ([example file](content/_template/index.mdx)).

Main libraries responsibe for this:

- [mdx-nfi (for frontmatter)](lib/mdx-nfi/index.ts)
- [mdx-nci (for content)](lib/mdx-nci/index.ts)
- [mdx-next-image-props](lib/mdx-next-image-props/index.ts)
- [token-parser](lib/token-parser/index.ts)
