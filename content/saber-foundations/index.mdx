### The Idea

Having already built templates, I noticed that
some aspects of the templates could be simplified.
They all have a similar structure with overlapping
elements that could be automated. With this in mind,
I started working on new plugins for PostHTML and
ParcelJS.

Taking inspiration from the developers' philosophy
at Vercel, I wanted to build on the idea of minimum
effort tools with great defaults. Removing the need
for tedious tasks and pushing for reusability.

### A proof of concept with influence

While not perfect, I managed to test a few concepts
I had in mind without compromising the website's
performance, resulting in a movement towards better
development tools. Several projects contain some
elements, making it the starting point for this
new idea.
