<Column title="Concluding notes">

### Some backstory on this project.

Interestingly enough, this was technically my first project for
a business before I went to university to study. Before I went,
I worked as a sales and workshop assistant at the shop, and the
initial version of this project never went live. The project
underwent three iterations, with the second version going live
when I returned from university.

The backstory of this project played a significant role in my
pursuit of becoming a developer. The owner, my colleagues, and
even the lesson learnt while working here pushed me to be a
better person. So a massive shout out to them!
