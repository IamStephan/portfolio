<Column title="Concluding notes">

### A brief backstory

Starting off my freelancing, a friend and I designed and
built this website after getting the opportunity when
Gerimed's developer decided to leave. I created the website
and, said friend, designed it. About a year after we had
launched the initial version, I decided to redo the website
to better match what I could do.

This project was one of two projects that I did with the owner.
Both projects have gone over two refactors, with the second
project being much more complex.
