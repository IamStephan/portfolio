<Column title="Concluding notes">

### Learning a novel CMS and PHP

When I first joined Leverage BPO, I already had experience
working in headless CMS's written in Javascript. I did not,
however, have experience working in a PHP-based CMS, much
less one that was proprietary. Determined to make this work,
I learned PHP within two months and used my previous knowledge
of architecting systems to build a base on which future
templates and projects could rely.
