        <h3>I like to solve problems</h3>
        <p>
          Driven by a curious mindset, I've built and deployed projects of all
          sizes for the past few yearsâ€”tinkering and tweaking with code until I
          have the best solution.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I'm a Frontend web developer for Leverage BPO, where I
          materialize the work of skilled and professional designers into
          results-driven websites. I keep myself well-versed in modern
          development practices, all the while enjoying what I do.
        </p>
        <h3>When I'm not on the job</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy going on outdoor adventures with my bicycle, falling while
          learning new skateboard tricks at the local park, having a good laugh,
          and entertaining my fascination with UX/UI. I like to take an
          enthusiastic approach to development and experiment with different
          approaches to see what works best.
        </p>
