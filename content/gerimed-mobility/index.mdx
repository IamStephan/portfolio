<Column title="Concluding notes">

### Project scope

Without a doubt, the scope of this project was humongous.
I was already comfortable creating the storefront but had
little experience with the backend.

#### Security

Keeping security as the primary objective, I researched various
approaches to dealing with the backend, ensuring the entire
setup was PCI-compliant. A few pain relievers came from the owner
and the way he wanted to deal with payments.

#### Online payments and deliveries

Although I wanted to implement a full payment and delivery system,
the owner prefered having a quote-based system and manual handling
of orders. This was a massive relief for me as I did not have to
deal with payments and deliveries.

I did, however, implement a cart system, an order management system,
and quotes and invoices generation from the ground up

#### API handling and the storefront architecture

Using React as the focal point for the storefront meant I had to make
architecture decisions that would typically not be of interest in static
sites. With React being only a library, I decided to follow the MVC
pattern (Model-View-Controller).

The main setup for this patterns was:

- Model ➜ GraphQL (From Strapi)
- View ➜ React
- Controller ➜ xState (Finite state machines)

Following this pattern allowed me to separate logic, have clear insights
on the data model being used, and create global and scoped states that
are predictable.
