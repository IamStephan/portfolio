<Column title="Concluding notes">

### Overcoming IOS restrictions

Initially, I built this app with React Native CLI,
as it's my preferred environment; I quickly ran into
the issue of not being able to run the app on IOS.
Since I used a few native modules, switching to Expo
wasn't as simple as it seemed. After an entire rewrite
and some alternatives to the native modules, I was
finally able to get it to run on the owner's phone.
